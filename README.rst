There are four main modules in **sponge**:

- ``Sponge`` reads in the command line arguments and controls when to restart its scan.
- ``GetAllHandler`` handles the dht connection, selects the channels, and does the get all query.
- ``ProfileHandler`` loads the profile and checks the update time of the profile and does the remove query.
- ``RecordCounter`` logs the results of **sponge** to the output and to the log file.
